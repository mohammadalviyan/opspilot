# OpsPilot

OpsPilot is an internal RPA operations dashboard for ticketing, robot monitoring, asset monitoring, and operational reporting.

This repository is prepared as a monorepo with separate backend and frontend applications. Feature implementation is driven by one task file at a time from `tasks/`.

## Project Structure

```txt
opspilot/
  backend/            # Go API application
  frontend/           # Next.js / React application
  docs/               # Product, architecture, API, and decision docs
  backlog/            # Backlog and project status
  tasks/              # One executable task file per work item
  prompts/            # Agent prompt references
  AGENTS.md           # Agent working rules
  README.md
```

## Initial Setup

No application runtime has been initialized yet. The current foundation only prepares the repository layout and environment placeholders.

1. Copy backend environment defaults when backend implementation starts:

   ```sh
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   ```

2. Copy frontend environment defaults when frontend implementation starts:

   ```sh
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
   ```

Future tasks will add Docker Compose, the Go API, database migrations, and the Next.js app shell.

## Working Rules

- Read `AGENTS.md` before making changes.
- Execute exactly one task from `tasks/` per session.
- Keep changes inside the active task scope.
- Update the active task status and `backlog/STATUS.md` after completing work.
- Record technical decisions in `docs/DECISIONS.md` when a new decision is made.
